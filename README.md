# SUTD-50.042-Labs
Labs completed for the ISTD Course 50.042 Foundations of Cybersecurity.

## Lab 1: Introduction and Shiftciphers
Write a shift cipher for ascii and binary

## Lab 2: Cipher Breaking
Decrypt ciphertext using a Substitution Cipher and One-Time Pad, break a substitution cipher using or frequency analysis, and manipulate OTP ciphertext to a target plaintext string.

## Lab 3: MD5 and Rainbow Tables
Hash passwords using MD5, crack MD5 hashes using brute-force and rainbow tables, and strengthen MD5 hash using salt and crack again the salted hashes.

## Lab 4: Block Cipher
Implement the ultra-lightweight PRESENT block cipher.

## Lab 5: Modular Arithmetics
Implement a class to do Number Theory computation in GF(2^n), and implement Byte Substitution layer of AES encryption.

## Lab 6: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
Implement Square-Multiply for large integer exponentiation, implement Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, and implement Shanksâ€™ Baby-step Giant-step method.

## Lab 7: RSA
Generate keys, encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify using RSA.
