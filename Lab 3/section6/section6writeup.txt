# Section 6

I used an online hash decryptor, hashes.com, to crack the hashes.

The website returns a list of passwords in the form of <hash>:<password>.

Although its mechanism is not properly documented and it is not an open source tool, my deduction is as follows:

They have a huge database of hash-to-passwords, as it is stated on their website that "We have been building our hash database since August 2007." From this statement, I believe that there are rainbow tables and what the website does is similar to how rainbowcracker looks up passwords in rainbow tables to matches the hashes to their corresponding passwords. 

It is unclear how these password-to-hashes are generated, but referring to their statement "We have been building our hash database since August 2007." again, I would think that they include hashes of more common passwords used by people rather than brute force passwords and hash them.
