# Section 5

Intuitively, salted rcrack strategies would generally take a longer time to find the corresponding plaintext in the rainbow table as compared to non-salted rcrack strategies, as there is a much bigger space of possible hash-to-password pairs.

However, using rcrack to solve the non-salted hashes took 16.234s while using rcrack to solve the salted hashes took 15.028s. This is against the expectations stated earlier as the time taken to solve the non-salted hashes is slightly longer than that of the salted hashes.

It is also worthy to note that many of the hashes for the salted hashes are not found as the rcrack only manages to find 8 out of 15 of them, whereas all of the 15 non-salted hashes are found in the rainbow table. It may be the case where it takes longer to write a found hash than report that the hash is not found, thus leading to the results as stated.
